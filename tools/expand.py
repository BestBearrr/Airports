        Available functions:
        \n\n
        In [airspace] boundary=, [area] points=, or the route= of an [approach/departure/transition], specify "!<name>" instead of lat, lon
        to substitute the lat, lon from the fix with the corresponding name in [airspace] beacons=. In [airport] sids=, "!<name>"
        can also be specified, and will become name, lat, lon instead. In [approach/departure/transition], "!<name>" can also be specified
        in beacon=, where it will become the full fix definition.
        \n\n
        In [airport] airlines=, definitions with frequency >10 with be broken down into multiple definitions of frequency 10 or less.
        \n\n
        In [airport], you can define gateways=, a list of <name>, direction. If gateways= is defined, the ", <directions>"" in
        [airport] airlines= becomes ", <arrival_gateways>, <departure_gateways>", and the directions are used based on the defined
        gateways. Default gateways can be specified in a common.ini in the same directory as the source file, or in the folder where
        this tool is located; gateways= still needs to be defined in an [airport] to activate this feature for the [airport].
        \n\n
        In [airport] airlines=, the airline <pronunciation> can be omitted if [meta] callsigns= is true. A lookup will be loaded from
        [expand.callsigns] defined in a common.ini in the same directory as the source file, or in the folder where this tool is
        located. The former takes precedence. [expand.callsigns] is a list of <code>, <pronunciation>. The first item in each
        line of airlines (stripped of a dash and anything after it, hereafter referred to as the "key") is used to lookup in
        [expand.callsigns] to obtain the pronunciation. If nothing is found, pronunication defaults to the key if it is longer than
        3 characters (assuming it is a military callsign), otherwise it defaults to "0".
        \n\n
        In a [approach/transition] route=, specify "@<name>" to "tag" the approach route. Any subsequent [approach] route= can then
        specify "@<name>" as the last point to chain the approach route tagged as "name" to the end.
        \n\n
        In a [departure] route=, specify "@<name>" to "tag" the route. This will remove the departure route from the resulting file
        (as it is an incomplete departure route). Any subsequent [departure] route= can then specify "@<name>" as the *first* point
        (second line, after the route name) to chain the departure route tagged as "name" to the beginning.
        \n\n
        *n as the first line of a [departure] route= value will repeat that route n times. Obviously, a repeated route= cannot be
        tagged as it wouldn't make any sense.''')
