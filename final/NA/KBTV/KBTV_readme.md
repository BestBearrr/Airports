#KBTV Burlington Approach		v1.1		4/2/2022

##Overview

Airspace covers the area over Lake Champlain in western Vermont and northeastern New York.  Airspace underlies ZBW Montpelier Sector (ZBW52) and adjoins it to the west, south and east.  BTV adjoins Montreal Center (ZUL) Granby Sector to the northeast and Montreal Terminal (YUL) to the northwest.

BTV airspace only extends up to 10,000 ft but the "above" and "ceiling" values are set higher to allow arrivals to be descended to the proper 11,000 ft altitude.  There are no surrounding approach shelves, although a chunk of ZBW airspace to the east within ~10 nm and of the border, 7,000 ft and above, is granted to BTV to assist in landing RWY 33 at KBTV to prevent diversions when sending aircraft direct to the IAFs.  R6501A, B are implemented and active up to 12,000 ft (can't be set higher due to game limitations).  All MVAs are implemented

Managing BTV is primarily about carefully managing the flow of GA and jet traffic into KBTV while working with very high surrounding MVAs due to the mountainous terrain.  Depending on the runway configuration, departure/arrival traffic to KPBG can conflict with the primary KBTV arrival/departure flow.  BTV is not designed to handle large volumes of traffic and at high scores holding will be necessary to manage the volume.

IRL, BTV also delegates an arrival corridor, 8,000-10,000 ft, to YUL for the purpose of handling large YUL arrival volume, but this is not implemented, nor is it depicted.

##Burlington International Airport, KBTV

International airport for BTV, majority of traffic flow.  The Burlington TACAN , BJA, is located on the field, while the BTV VOR is located a few miles to the south.  A good mix of GA and jet traffic, as well as some military flights.

2 runways, 15/33 and 19/01.  15/33 is the preferred runway, and is the only runway that jet aircraft *should* land on.  19/01 should only be used for GA and small prop aircraft.  All configurations will allow a combo of either 15 and 19 or 33 and 01 to be used.  LAHSO procedures do exist, but are not implemented due to the extremely short runway lengths.  As a result, simultaneous approaches do need to be timed to prevent a go-around due to traffic on the runway.  No SIDS, all departures fly runway heading.

There are no *specific* arrival routes, all KBTV arrivals are cleared direct to the airport or the VOR.


##Plattsburgh International Airport, KPBG (implemented as PG)

Secondary untowered airport located west of KBTV, mix of GA and jet traffic.  No VOR located on the field, but the fix PBERG (replacement for PBG VOR) is located north of the field.

1 runway, 17/35.  Formerly Plattsburgh Airforce Base before closure, now a civil airport.  Traffic is light and all conflicts are with the main KBTV flows.  No SIDS exist, and all traffic will fly headings)

##Suggested Techniques

Landing BTV 15/19, PBG 17:

Do not descend BTV arrival traffic to 3,000 when west of the BTV 15 localizer, that airspace is needed for PBG departures.  Keeping BTV arrival traffic high and further to the west of the airport to set up for a long final creates room to climb PBG departures and send them on course.  Using the fixes for BTV RNAV 15 is unwise except for low traffic flows.  BTV RWY 19 intersects RWY 15 very close to the 19 threshold, so arrivals to RWY 19 do not conflict with RWY 15 arrivals for very long.  Only GA arrivals should be put on RWY 19 (for realism).  BTV departures eastbound may conflict with R6501 when put on course.

Landing BTV 33/01, PBG 35:

KBTV landers *must* be put on the RNAV Z 33 via JANUD, DONGY or ALOKY in order to properly capture the glideslope without causing an area violation.  Watch the spacing in the turn onto final at JANUD.  KPBG landers are generally only a factor with KBTV departures, so leave some room for the intial climb.

Landing BTV 15/19, PBG 35:

Simultaneous approaches to BTV and PBG are possible, but does require keeping the BTV arrivals further to the west and high up to allow descent of PBG arrivals to the final.  Departure traffic has very little in the way of airborne conflicts, but area restrictions can be a factor.

Landing BTV 33/01, PBG 17:

Strange configuration, arrival traffic is completely isolated from each other, but departure traffic will heavily conflict.  Watch before sending aircraft on course.
