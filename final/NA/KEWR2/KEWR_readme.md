# `KEWR` - Newark Liberty International Airport
This is my take on Newark Liberty International Airport (KEWR) in Newark, NJ.
#It's got four configurations - two standard ones, landing 4R/22L and departing 4L/22R, and two special ones 
#normally used during high crosswinds, where you land planes via the RNAV to 29! For these, rather than vectoring 
#planes into the ils, you should send them direct to the waypoint TETER when in a northern flow, and KILMA when
#in a southern flow. Clear them for the APP from there, and they will automatically follow the RNAV in to the runway!
#Aside from that, the three major reliver airports, Teterboro, Caldwell, and Morristown, are all represented as well. 
#There are a few minor sticking points. Occasionally, departures out of TEB may interfere with arrivals on the ILS to 22L at Newark,
#and departures from Caldwell's 22 may interfere with arrivals on the ILS to Morristown's 23. I've tried to reduce them as much as possible
#but I couldn't do everything.
