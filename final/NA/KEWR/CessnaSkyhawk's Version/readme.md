# `KEWR` Newark Liberty International Airport & N90 EWR Area ARTCC
This is my take on KEWR and all its surrounding satellite airports (Teterboro, Caldwell, and Morristown). I've got two different versions of it, for different types of players.

## KEWR.txt 
KEWR.txt is a more EATC-style config, with more runways open, and less well-defined STARs, encouraging more vectoring and allowing for higher traffic loads.

## KEWR_Realistic.txt 
KEWR_Realistic.txt is more realistic, with built in arrival routes to allow for planes to follow the real-life flow that irl controllers use. It has less runways open, and only uses real-world configurations.
