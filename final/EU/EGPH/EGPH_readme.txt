EGPH

Edinburgh Radar // PH INT

by Vivek Chanda // Discord: vjc009

This is v1 of EGPH for EndlessATC. The file attempts to simulate the functions of PH INT (Bbx w/ FIN) in the most realistic way
possible, however, due to the many many limitations of this program, there will be a few inaccuracies.

IRL, Scottish would descend aircraft to MSL for the two available stacks, and if holding is osccuring, MSL + 1, + 2, etc.
However, as MSL can not be read from the game, the decision was made to simply have the player descent aircraft to the appropriate
levels manually.

All standard departures are handled by Scottish as well, and as there is no way to enable departures without being forced to take
control of them, the decision was made to forgo departures.
Really, there would be no conflicts to handle and the aircraft would be appropriately handled by Scottish, so there is no real reason
to include them.

The 3nm buffer zone to protect against conflicts against aircraft being worked by Glasgow APC has also been omitted for now, as there
isn't any coordination in the game that would give it any function. However for completion sake and realism, I most likely will add it
later.

Various other radar features such as the coastline/CTA boundary/etc, has not been included, as they once again have no real function
in this game.
Only relevant beacons have been included.

This readme will be updated with more information when I can. Feel free to contribute, and any feedback or suggestions you can reach 
out to me on Discord. As of now, for details on how to control this file, the best available resource is the current EGPH vMATS Part 2
from VATSIM UK.
