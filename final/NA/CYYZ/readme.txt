EATC CYYZ README

General Information

YYZ:

Active Runways:
- 24 runways are active 99% of the time.
- 24R is used for 90% of arrivals, 23 is only used if 24R is busy.
- 23 is used for takeoffs when 24's are active.
- Runway 24L is barely ever used (landings or takeoffs). I turned it off in configurations to declutter and make things easier (Same applies to 06R). If you want it on, just make a new configuration.
- 06's, 33's and 15's are only used if winds are very strong and facing the wrong direction.
NOTE: This is a general observation made by me. You may see other runways being used for takeoffs/landings so just change the configurations accordingly. 

Other:
- 23 is the longest runway, so direct any emergencies there.

Noise Abatement:
- From 12 AM to 6:30 AM local time, departures are prohibited on 05, 06L, 06R, 15L and 15R and arrivals are prohibited on 24R, 24L, 23, 33R, 33L and 15R.
- Aircraft must maintain 3000 until the localizer is captured.
NOTE: In cases of emergencies, MEDEVAC flights or strong weather, these rules don't apply.

YTZ:

NOTE: I know that 26 doesn't have an ILS. I chose to add it anyways because 26 gets most of the landings and LOC approaches basically work the same way.

Active Runways:
- 26 is mostly used (departures and arrivals).
- 08 is equipped with ILS.

Other:
- YTZ has 2 runways: 08/26 and 06/24.
- Currently, only 08/26 are in the file.

Noise Abatement:
- All jet aircraft are prohibited from using the airport.
NOTE: Emergencies and MEDEVAC flights do not follow noise abatement rules.
