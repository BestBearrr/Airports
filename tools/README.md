In this directory are a few tools useful for writing Endless ATC airport files. You can see examples of its usage in RJTT and RJCC.

The tools are Python 3 scripts. They have not been tested in Python 2. There should be no dependencies.

Depending on your platform, you will need to run 'python3 deploy.py', 'python deploy.py', or possibly even 'deploy.py' will work.

For further help, view the help available by running 'python deploy.py -h'

If you find any bugs, you can report on the community Discord.
